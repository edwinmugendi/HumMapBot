It uses API.AI for Natural Language Processing and then the data is retrieved from https://airtable.com/tblUipcy7ixUIEjYF

HumMapBot is built using Laravel 4.2 PHP framework.

It integrates to 3 API's:

2. API.AI API
3. Airtable API

How to setup HumMapBot.
1. Clone the repo
2. Open /app/configs/SETUP.php file and run the commands in this file in your command line.
